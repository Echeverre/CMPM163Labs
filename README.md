Lab 5: 
I chose to do part one on Unity
Here is the video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rn4aGQ-F8f-nXfqEBejHOXW82g2m5f83/view?usp=sharing
I made the particles a dark gray and reversed gravity so that it would be kinda like a smoke effect. I also changed the mountains in the background to be more purple and the hills that were up close to be more orange, and changed the clouds to be sort of reddish to make the scene seem more "sunset-like." I did this all by changing the albedo for all those materials using the color editor. 
When I went to upload the project to github, it was too large, and I couldn't get the .gitignore to work, so I only uploaded the asset that I modified from the assignment, I hope that that is alright

Lab 6:
I chose to do part 2 with shadertoy
